# Fungus condensation

This project investigates the interplay between condensation and fungal growth. There are two phenomena we want to look at:

1. Fungi thrive with condensation;
2. Some fungi develop spotty colony patterns. 

Like all living organisms, the growth of fungi is subject to both physical constraints and biological regulations. Our lab is not capable of investigating the biological aspect, so we limit our scope to the physical aspect. 

To implement this limit, we assume that fungi like water very much: the more the better. They thrive in the environment by harvesting as much water as they can. Any physical mechanism that favors water harvesting helps fungal growth. On the contrary, any physical mechanism that limits water harvesting hinders fungal growth. This assumption could be supported by many papers (to a limited extent, in that high humidity typically make fungi grow for longer time, but not necessarily increase the growth rate). 

With this assumption, we want to see whether condensation plays the key role in the two phenomena. Here are the two hypotheses we'd like to test:

1. Fungal growth is faster with condensation;
2. Fungi develop spotty colony patterns with condensation (cycles).
