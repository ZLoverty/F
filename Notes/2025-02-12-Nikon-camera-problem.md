# Nikon camera problem

In the past few months, I had a vibration issue with the imaging using the Nikon camera. Intuitively, lowering the exposure time would solve it, but no matter how low I set (down to 1 ms), the vibration issue persisted, evidenced by the motion-blurred image. 

Today, I found the cause of the issue: the Camera Control Pro 2 software! When the preview mode is on, I can set the exposure time to any value, but it does not take effect. The real exposure time is always long ($> 0.1$ s). As a result, the vibration issue persists for even small exposure time. 

When I exit the preview mode, the shutter noise was noticeably shorter, and I was able to get images without motion blur!

When using the stackshot, the lens vibrates after each step. As a result, making a good stack image is still challenging since the images that form a stack do not necessarily align well, and the quality of the stacking relies on the aligning algorithm.

A little bit delay time might improve the stacking quality. I will test it out when the setup is free.
