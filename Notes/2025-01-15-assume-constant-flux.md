# Assume constant flux

[The flux obtained by taking the derivative of total volume](2024-09-10-condensation-flux.md) is quite noisy. Here, we assume the flux is a constant in each distance band and compute the flux again. 

We start by fitting the total volume in the condensation stage with a linear line. As shown below, the linear relation appears to be a valid assumption.

We then take the slope of each curve and divide them by the corresponding band surface area to get the constant flux. The flux as a function of distance is shown below.

Interestingly, the flux decreases as the distance increases. This is opposite to our expectation based on the conceptual picture where more vapor is directed towards the fungus. 

We also notice that from 8 to 10 minutes, the increase of volume is obviously larger at larger distance. So we also quantify the "early flux". The result suggests that at early times, the flux near the fungal patch is small.

The early stage data can be inaccurate, as we only have two data points in time to get the rate of volume increase. Ideally, we can get more time resolved data to verify this early stage trend. 

In general. more data is desired.
